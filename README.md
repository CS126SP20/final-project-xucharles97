## Introduction

For my final project, I made a platformer game using the Box2D engine.

## Gameplay

The controls for this game are fairly straightforward - you use the arrow keys to move, press up to jump, and press left and right to go in that respective direction.

There are two main advanced movement options programmed into this game. First is a double jump, which should be pretty self-explanatory - you can jump once off the ground and then again in midair. Landing on the ground allows you to regain both your jumps.

The other mechanic is what I like to call a "Wall-Cling Reset". Basically, when you jump into the side of a wall, then let go and jump again, you'll regain both of your jumps without having to touch the ground. The timing is precise but it's very rewarding.

## Levels

All the levels (as they were originally planned), were fairly straightforward. You start on one side of the screen, and there is a door you must reach on the other side. Once you get to that door, you the next level will load.
